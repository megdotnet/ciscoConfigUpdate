- add that one fuction for passwords
- change credentials.py to global_var.py
- edit list-creator, simple_conn, confi_change to use global_var.py
* change ip_list to a .csv
- can I add a ping test?
* can I check for and handle duplicate entries in KRON
* should I have it match the ip address of the old server before removing?
* create confirm.py to just pull the current cli job from the hardware
* need to be able to add the kron job to switches that don't already have it. 
* sort out github nonsense
* change the kron time so they're not all sending at once.  Maybe use a random number generator.
